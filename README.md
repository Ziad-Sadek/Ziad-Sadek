Hi there! 👋

I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting. My passion for coding and web development led me to pursue a career in tech, where I focus on creating responsive web designs and intuitive UI/UX experiences. 💻✨

In addition to my love for development, I’m also proud to be a member of the National Cycling Team of Egypt 🚴‍♂️🇪🇬. Being an athlete has taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—qualities I bring into every project I work on.

I specialize in transforming ideas into visually appealing and functional websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. My strong foundation in business and accounting gives me a unique perspective on problem-solving, attention to detail, and delivering high-quality results.

When I'm not coding or cycling, you can find me exploring new design trends, improving my skills, and learning more about the ever-evolving world of front-end development. 🌱
